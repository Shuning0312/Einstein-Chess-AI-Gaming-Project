# Einstein-Chess-AI-Gaming-Project
- **Project Introduction:** Master the principles and programming implementation of game theory algorithms, combined with Monte Carlo algorithm, Expectimax algorithm, UCT algorithm, as well as Q-Learning algorithm in reinforcement learning, to compute and simulate the optimal chess moves, thus realizing the process of computer gaming. 
- **The main implementation content of the project:** Using the WinBGIm graphics library to design the interface of a chess software, implementing basic functions such as human-computer gameplay and saving chess information files through C programming language. This significantly increased the game's winning rate, leading to achieving a national-level third prize in chess competitions.
